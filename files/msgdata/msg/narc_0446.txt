Dr. Footstep: Pokémon are quite easy\nfor me to read.\rI need only to see their footprints,\nand their innermost thoughts are\frevealed to me!\rOh?\nYou are skeptical of my claim?\rThen, let your {STRVAR_1 0, 0} walk\nin front of me, right here.\rFrom its footprints, I will determine\nhow it feels about you.\r
Dr. Footstep: Do you want to check\nthe feelings of your Pokémon again?\rThen, let your {STRVAR_1 0, 0} walk\nin front of me, right here.\rFrom its footprints, I will determine\nhow it feels about you.\r
Dr. Footstep: ...And that is what\nyour {STRVAR_1 0, 0} thinks of you.
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmmm... {STRVAR_1 0, 0}\ndoesn’t leave any footprints.\rIt’s somewhat difficult for me to\ndetermine what its thoughts are.
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmm... {STRVAR_1 0, 0}\nhappens to be quite the silent type!
Dr. Footstep: ...And that is what\nyour {STRVAR_1 0, 0} thinks of you.\rI must say, your {STRVAR_1 0, 0} and\nyou share a very close bond.\fThis is for you.\r
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmmm... {STRVAR_1 0, 0}\ndoesn’t leave any footprints.\rIt’s somewhat difficult for me to\ndetermine what its thoughts are.\rHowever, your {STRVAR_1 0, 0} and\nyou obviously share a close bond.\fThis is for you.\r
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmm... {STRVAR_1 0, 0}\nhappens to be quite the silent type!\rHowever, your {STRVAR_1 0, 0} and\nyou obviously share a close bond.\fThis is for you.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1} received\nthe Footprint Ribbon.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1} put the Footprint Ribbon\non {STRVAR_1 0, 0}.
Aww... {STRVAR_1 3, 1} only plays with\nother Pokémon...\r{STRVAR_1 1, 2} feels neglected...\rMaybe {STRVAR_1 3, 1} doesn’t like\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2} very much?\r{STRVAR_1 1, 2} will try harder for\n{STRVAR_1 3, 1}.\rPlease be nicer to me!\r
Others say there are people who\naren’t very nice to Pokémon.\rI wonder about {STRVAR_1 3, 1}...\rWill {STRVAR_1 3, 1} look after\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2} nicely?\rWill I get to go all over with this\nTrainer?\rCan we be... Friends?\r
This adventure with {STRVAR_1 3, 1}\nis lots of fun.\r{STRVAR_1 1, 2} gets to go places where\nI can’t go by myself.\rI get to battle Pokémon I’ve never\never seen before.\rI’m gonna get stronger and stronger\nfor {STRVAR_1 3, 1}!\r
{STRVAR_1 1, 2} and {STRVAR_1 3, 1} make\na perfectly matched combo!\rI’ve seen all sorts of people\nso far...\rBut {STRVAR_1 3, 1} understands\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2}’s feelings most!\rI’m a little hungry...\nYou can tell, right?\r
If I said there can be friendship\nbetween Pokémon and people, will\f{STRVAR_1 0, 0}’s friends understand?\rBut if you see {STRVAR_1 3, 1} and\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2}, you will understand.\rBecause {STRVAR_1 3, 1} and\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2} are friends!\r
{STRVAR_1 1, 2} is bored...\nPlay with me more, more...\r{STRVAR_1 1, 2} and {STRVAR_1 3, 1},\nlet’s play nicer...\r
Gonna go with {STRVAR_1 3, 1} all over\nthe place...\rBe nice to {STRVAR_1 1, 2}...\nWarm and cuddly...\r
{STRVAR_1 1, 2} get strong, make\n{STRVAR_1 3, 1} happy.\rRound ones, square ones,\ntriangle ones, wobbly ones...\r{STRVAR_1 1, 2} wants to see different\nkinds of Pokémon...\r
{STRVAR_1 1, 2} and {STRVAR_1 3, 1}\nmake a friendly combo.\r{STRVAR_1 3, 1}’s feelings, {STRVAR_1 1, 2}\ncan understand.\r{STRVAR_1 1, 2}’s feelings, {STRVAR_1 3, 1}\nunderstands!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1} makes {STRVAR_1 1, 2}\nvery proud!\r{STRVAR_1 0, 0} boasts to friends\nabout {STRVAR_1 3, 1}!\r{STRVAR_1 3, 1} and {STRVAR_1 1, 2} are\nbest of friends!\r
Why does {STRVAR_1 3, 1} use only\nother Pokémon?\rAm I not needed much?\rWould I have been better off if\nI remained in the wild?\rNo, I should give this Trainer\na little more of a chance...\r
Humans can’t understand the cries\nof Pokémon, nor our feelings.\rHowever, there are some among us\nthat understand human speech...\rHehehe, {STRVAR_1 3, 1}, you’re not bad\nfor a human.\r
If a Pokémon were to travel along,\nit would be limited as to where\fit could go.\rBut traveling with a human, a Pokémon\nwould be able to travel farther afield\fto more distant cities and lands.\rTraveling with {STRVAR_1 3, 1} has been\nrewarding and reassuring.\rAnd very entertaining...\r
Some wild Pokémon frown upon others\nfor traveling with humans.\rThey jeer that the caught Pokémon\nhave “forgotten the wild.”\rBut that view is mistaken.\rThey have just never met a Trainer\nwho could be a great partner.\rA great partner like {STRVAR_1 3, 1},\nin other words...\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1} is...\nA remarkable human and Trainer.\rThat I can always perform the best\nany {STRVAR_1 0, 0} possibly can...\rI attribute that entirely to my\npartner {STRVAR_1 3, 1}.\rWhen we travel, I can see wild\nPokémon eyeing us enviously...\r
Does {STRVAR_1 3, 1} intend to ignore\nme forever?\rGive me more opportunities for me\nto shine...\r
If a Pokémon is treated as a friend,\nit will return the sentiments.\rWe grow fonder of humans that treat\nus with kindness...\rDoes {STRVAR_1 3, 1} even like\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2}?\r
Did {STRVAR_1 1, 2} get stronger?\nWho is responsible for making me so?\rIs it {STRVAR_1 3, 1}’s doing?\nIs the Trainer owed my thanks?\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1} and {STRVAR_1 1, 2} are\nalike in some ways.\rIn humanspeak, we match up well.\nDoes {STRVAR_1 3, 1} think so, too?\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1} is very impressive,\nespecially for a human.\rThe Trainer lets {STRVAR_1 1, 2} use\nevery bit of power properly.\rIt is a shame that {STRVAR_1 3, 1} is\nonly a human...\r
That {STRVAR_1 3, 1}...\nWhat is that Trainer thinking?\rWhy make me join the team, then call\nupon me for nothing?\rAm I considered useless?\nIs the Trainer regretting having me?\rDoes the Trainer dare disrespect\nthis {STRVAR_1 0, 0} so easily?\r
I have little understanding of\n{STRVAR_1 3, 1} as a human...\r{STRVAR_1 3, 1} may not be too bad,\nconsidering that I, an oft-shunned\f{STRVAR_1 0, 0}, am one of the team...\rThat said, I don’t intend to be all\ncheerful around {STRVAR_1 3, 1}...\r
Our kind prefers to lurk in dark\nand dank places...\rBut being with {STRVAR_1 3, 1}, even\nbright and festive places seem less\fthreatening...\r{STRVAR_1 3, 1} has a strange\ncharisma...\r
Not for a moment did I think I would\nbe traveling with a human...\rIf my {STRVAR_1 0, 0} friends were to\nsee me now, they would be shocked.\rOr would they be envious of me...?\r
That {STRVAR_1 3, 1} is the most\nimpressive of humans.\rIt takes a lot to make me,\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2}, sunny and cheerful!\rAs a show of affection, I should\nchomp down on the Trainer’s neck...\rHahaha... Have no fear...\nI was merely joking...\r
Wooooooh...\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2} has nothing to do...\rKeep me too bored, and I’m liable\nto sneak up and bite...\r
Is there any human that would grow\nto like us {STRVAR_1 0, 0}?\rWell? Does {STRVAR_1 3, 1} like\n{STRVAR_1 1, 2}?\r{STRVAR_1 1, 2} doesn’t like...\nWell, no, maybe not...\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1} treats me, {STRVAR_1 1, 2},\nnicely without being scared.\rBut {STRVAR_1 1, 2} will be even scarier\nfrom now on.\rThat’s what we {STRVAR_1 0, 0} do...\r
{STRVAR_1 1, 2} is starting to forget\na little about being in the wild...\rBut {STRVAR_1 1, 2} isn’t feeling sad.\nIt’s never boring with {STRVAR_1 3, 1}...\r
There are no Pokémon that dislike\nhumans...\rOnly humans that dislike Pokémon...\rWe {STRVAR_1 0, 0} are especially\nshunned...\rBut {STRVAR_1 3, 1} always treats me\nas a friend and partner...\r
Hnurrrr... Hunh?\nThis is... Where?\r{STRVAR_1 3, 1}’s house, is this?\nIt’s not? Hnurrr...\rIf you don’t need me for anything,\ncan I go back to my Ball?\rHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nI like to sleep most the time.\fOh, I like to eat, too. That’s next.\rBut what I really like is to think.\nI’m a very deep thinker.\rWhen I think about the future of the\n{STRVAR_1 0, 0} species...\r...Hnurrr...hunh?\nOh, I forget where the time goes.\rHnurrrr...\r
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nThere are lots of kinds of moves.\rI like those Dark-type moves,\noh, and Dragon-type moves, too...\rHow would they be for this\n{STRVAR_1 0, 0}?\rWill they be for me?\nOr a no, no, no sort of thing?\rHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... I don’t know how to begin\nsaying this...\rI liked living quietly before I met\n{STRVAR_1 3, 1}. Sssh.\rBut I’m getting to like traveling\nwith {STRVAR_1 3, 1}.\rI think I’m getting sort of funky.\nDo you think I’m sort of funky?\rNo? No funk for me?\nHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nOther Pokémon, they say to me...\r“You’re not thinking, are you?”\nHow insulting they should say so.\rIt isn’t true what they say.\nThink, think, think, I do that.\rAll the time, I think hard how to help\n{STRVAR_1 3, 1}. I concentrate!\rHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... I did not know that?\nI really don’t? What is this?\fI don’t know what to say?\fHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... Well, I...\nI think I’m motivated.\fAs motivated as the average.\fBut it’s not so simple as that.\fHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... How should I say this?\nWe both look out for each other.\fThat’s what we try to do, I think.\fThat is for the best.\fHnurrrr...\r
Hnurrr... How do I say?\nHow should I describe us?\rWe are the sound of both hands\nclapping.\r{STRVAR_1 3, 1} and I are together\nin synchronicity like twins.\rHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr...\nWhat is left to say, I say?\rWe have come so far now, where can\nwe go but to see this through?\rHall of Fame...\nWords so sweet fall from my mouth.\rHnurrr...\r
Sssshhnnn...\n...\f...Ssshhhnnn...\f...\fSsshhhnnn...\f...\r
