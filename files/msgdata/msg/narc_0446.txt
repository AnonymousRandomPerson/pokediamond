Dr. Footstep: Pokémon are quite easy\nfor me to read.\rI need only to see their footprints,\nand their innermost thoughts are\frevealed to me!\rOh?\nYou are skeptical of my claim?\rThen, let your {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} walk\nin front of me, right here.\rFrom its footprints, I will determine\nhow it feels about you.\r
Dr. Footstep: Do you want to check\nthe feelings of your Pokémon again?\rThen, let your {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} walk\nin front of me, right here.\rFrom its footprints, I will determine\nhow it feels about you.\r
Dr. Footstep: ...And that is what\nyour {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} thinks of you.
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmmm... {STRVAR 256, 1, 0}\ndoesn’t leave any footprints.\rIt’s somewhat difficult for me to\ndetermine what its thoughts are.
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmm... {STRVAR 256, 1, 0}\nhappens to be quite the silent type!
Dr. Footstep: ...And that is what\nyour {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} thinks of you.\rI must say, your {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} and\nyou share a very close bond.\fThis is for you.\r
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmmm... {STRVAR 256, 1, 0}\ndoesn’t leave any footprints.\rIt’s somewhat difficult for me to\ndetermine what its thoughts are.\rHowever, your {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} and\nyou obviously share a close bond.\fThis is for you.\r
Dr. Footstep: ...Hmm... {STRVAR 256, 1, 0}\nhappens to be quite the silent type!\rHowever, your {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} and\nyou obviously share a close bond.\fThis is for you.\r
{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} received\nthe Footprint Ribbon.\r
{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} put the Footprint Ribbon\non {STRVAR 256, 1, 0}.
Aww... {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} only plays with\nother Pokémon...\r{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} feels neglected...\rMaybe {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} doesn’t like\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} very much?\r{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} will try harder for\n{STRVAR 259, 1, 1}.\rPlease be nicer to me!\r
Others say there are people who\naren’t very nice to Pokémon.\rI wonder about {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}...\rWill {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} look after\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} nicely?\rWill I get to go all over with this\nTrainer?\rCan we be... Friends?\r
This adventure with {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}\nis lots of fun.\r{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} gets to go places where\nI can’t go by myself.\rI get to battle Pokémon I’ve never\never seen before.\rI’m gonna get stronger and stronger\nfor {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}!\r
{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} and {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} make\na perfectly matched combo!\rI’ve seen all sorts of people\nso far...\rBut {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} understands\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2}’s feelings most!\rI’m a little hungry...\nYou can tell, right?\r
If I said there can be friendship\nbetween Pokémon and people, will\f{STRVAR 256, 1, 0}’s friends understand?\rBut if you see {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} and\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2}, you will understand.\rBecause {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} and\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} are friends!\r
{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} is bored...\nPlay with me more, more...\r{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} and {STRVAR 259, 1, 1},\nlet’s play nicer...\r
Gonna go with {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} all over\nthe place...\rBe nice to {STRVAR 257, 1, 2}...\nWarm and cuddly...\r
{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} get strong, make\n{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} happy.\rRound ones, square ones,\ntriangle ones, wobbly ones...\r{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} wants to see different\nkinds of Pokémon...\r
{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} and {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}\nmake a friendly combo.\r{STRVAR 259, 1, 1}’s feelings, {STRVAR 257, 1, 2}\ncan understand.\r{STRVAR 257, 1, 2}’s feelings, {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}\nunderstands!\r
{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} makes {STRVAR 257, 1, 2}\nvery proud!\r{STRVAR 256, 1, 0} boasts to friends\nabout {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}!\r{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} and {STRVAR 257, 1, 2} are\nbest of friends!\r
Why does {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} use only\nother Pokémon?\rAm I not needed much?\rWould I have been better off if\nI remained in the wild?\rNo, I should give this Trainer\na little more of a chance...\r
Humans can’t understand the cries\nof Pokémon, nor our feelings.\rHowever, there are some among us\nthat understand human speech...\rHehehe, {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}, you’re not bad\nfor a human.\r
If a Pokémon were to travel along,\nit would be limited as to where\fit could go.\rBut traveling with a human, a Pokémon\nwould be able to travel farther afield\fto more distant cities and lands.\rTraveling with {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} has been\nrewarding and reassuring.\rAnd very entertaining...\r
Some wild Pokémon frown upon others\nfor traveling with humans.\rThey jeer that the caught Pokémon\nhave “forgotten the wild.”\rBut that view is mistaken.\rThey have just never met a Trainer\nwho could be a great partner.\rA great partner like {STRVAR 259, 1, 1},\nin other words...\r
{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} is...\nA remarkable human and Trainer.\rThat I can always perform the best\nany {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} possibly can...\rI attribute that entirely to my\npartner {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}.\rWhen we travel, I can see wild\nPokémon eyeing us enviously...\r
Does {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} intend to ignore\nme forever?\rGive me more opportunities for me\nto shine...\r
If a Pokémon is treated as a friend,\nit will return the sentiments.\rWe grow fonder of humans that treat\nus with kindness...\rDoes {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} even like\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2}?\r
Did {STRVAR 257, 1, 2} get stronger?\nWho is responsible for making me so?\rIs it {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}’s doing?\nIs the Trainer owed my thanks?\r
{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} and {STRVAR 257, 1, 2} are\nalike in some ways.\rIn humanspeak, we match up well.\nDoes {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} think so, too?\r
{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} is very impressive,\nespecially for a human.\rThe Trainer lets {STRVAR 257, 1, 2} use\nevery bit of power properly.\rIt is a shame that {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} is\nonly a human...\r
That {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}...\nWhat is that Trainer thinking?\rWhy make me join the team, then call\nupon me for nothing?\rAm I considered useless?\nIs the Trainer regretting having me?\rDoes the Trainer dare disrespect\nthis {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} so easily?\r
I have little understanding of\n{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} as a human...\r{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} may not be too bad,\nconsidering that I, an oft-shunned\f{STRVAR 256, 1, 0}, am one of the team...\rThat said, I don’t intend to be all\ncheerful around {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}...\r
Our kind prefers to lurk in dark\nand dank places...\rBut being with {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}, even\nbright and festive places seem less\fthreatening...\r{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} has a strange\ncharisma...\r
Not for a moment did I think I would\nbe traveling with a human...\rIf my {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} friends were to\nsee me now, they would be shocked.\rOr would they be envious of me...?\r
That {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} is the most\nimpressive of humans.\rIt takes a lot to make me,\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2}, sunny and cheerful!\rAs a show of affection, I should\nchomp down on the Trainer’s neck...\rHahaha... Have no fear...\nI was merely joking...\r
Wooooooh...\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} has nothing to do...\rKeep me too bored, and I’m liable\nto sneak up and bite...\r
Is there any human that would grow\nto like us {STRVAR 256, 1, 0}?\rWell? Does {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} like\n{STRVAR 257, 1, 2}?\r{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} doesn’t like...\nWell, no, maybe not...\r
{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} treats me, {STRVAR 257, 1, 2},\nnicely without being scared.\rBut {STRVAR 257, 1, 2} will be even scarier\nfrom now on.\rThat’s what we {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} do...\r
{STRVAR 257, 1, 2} is starting to forget\na little about being in the wild...\rBut {STRVAR 257, 1, 2} isn’t feeling sad.\nIt’s never boring with {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}...\r
There are no Pokémon that dislike\nhumans...\rOnly humans that dislike Pokémon...\rWe {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} are especially\nshunned...\rBut {STRVAR 259, 1, 1} always treats me\nas a friend and partner...\r
Hnurrrr... Hunh?\nThis is... Where?\r{STRVAR 259, 1, 1}’s house, is this?\nIt’s not? Hnurrr...\rIf you don’t need me for anything,\ncan I go back to my Ball?\rHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nI like to sleep most the time.\fOh, I like to eat, too. That’s next.\rBut what I really like is to think.\nI’m a very deep thinker.\rWhen I think about the future of the\n{STRVAR 256, 1, 0} species...\r...Hnurrr...hunh?\nOh, I forget where the time goes.\rHnurrrr...\r
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nThere are lots of kinds of moves.\rI like those Dark-type moves,\noh, and Dragon-type moves, too...\rHow would they be for this\n{STRVAR 256, 1, 0}?\rWill they be for me?\nOr a no, no, no sort of thing?\rHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... I don’t know how to begin\nsaying this...\rI liked living quietly before I met\n{STRVAR 259, 1, 1}. Sssh.\rBut I’m getting to like traveling\nwith {STRVAR 259, 1, 1}.\rI think I’m getting sort of funky.\nDo you think I’m sort of funky?\rNo? No funk for me?\nHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... Me? Uhm...\nOther Pokémon, they say to me...\r“You’re not thinking, are you?”\nHow insulting they should say so.\rIt isn’t true what they say.\nThink, think, think, I do that.\rAll the time, I think hard how to help\n{STRVAR 259, 1, 1}. I concentrate!\rHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... I did not know that?\nI really don’t? What is this?\fI don’t know what to say?\fHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... Well, I...\nI think I’m motivated.\fAs motivated as the average.\fBut it’s not so simple as that.\fHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr... How should I say this?\nWe both look out for each other.\fThat’s what we try to do, I think.\fThat is for the best.\fHnurrrr...\r
Hnurrr... How do I say?\nHow should I describe us?\rWe are the sound of both hands\nclapping.\r{STRVAR 259, 1, 1} and I are together\nin synchronicity like twins.\rHnurrr...\r
Hnurrr...\nWhat is left to say, I say?\rWe have come so far now, where can\nwe go but to see this through?\rHall of Fame...\nWords so sweet fall from my mouth.\rHnurrr...\r
Sssshhnnn...\n...\f...Ssshhhnnn...\f...\fSsshhhnnn...\f...\r
