Welcome!\rYou may exchange your Coins for\nfabulous prizes here!\r
Which prize would you like?
So your choice is\nthe {STRVAR_1 8, 0}?
So your choice is {STRVAR_1 8, 0}:\n{STRVAR_1 6, 1}?
Here you go!
You don’t have enough Coins.\r
There isn’t any room available for\nthat {STRVAR_1 8, 0}.\r
Oh, is that so? \nPlease come back with some Coins!
I love words like “walk-off,\ngrand-slam home run.”
They have prizes I really want, but\nit’d be tough saving up the Coins.
